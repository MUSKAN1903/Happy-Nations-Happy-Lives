A Deep Dive into the World Happiness Report.Embark on an insightful journey through the renowned "World Happiness Report," where we delve into the happiness scores and factors influencing well-being during the pivotal years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2020, and 2021, spanning both pre-COVID and mid-COVID eras.

- We commence with a meticulous analysis of the World Happiness Reports for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017, laying the foundation for understanding global happiness trends before the emergence of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.
- The project then transitions to the more recent years of 2020 and 2021, encompassing the mid-COVID period when the world faced significant challenges and uncertainties. Through the lens of data science, we will decipher how the pandemic might have impacted global happiness scores and the underlying factors influencing people's well-being.
- Drawing from the historical data and mid-COVID trends, we will undertake predictive modeling to forecast happiness scores for the future.
- By embracing the interplay of pre-COVID and mid-COVID data, this project aims to contribute significantly to the understanding of happiness dynamics and the effects of global challenges on well-being.
